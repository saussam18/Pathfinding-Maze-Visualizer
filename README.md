# Pathfinding-Maze-Visualizer

Welcome to my Pathfinding Visualizer Project inspired by a tutorial from Clement Mihailescu. It took me a while to finish between a lot of other activites I was doing and involved in and the fact that this was something complelty new for me in a lot of ways, but here is a version that is at a point where it can be published like this, so yay!

To play around with it, please click on this link: http://saussam18.github.io/Pathfinding-Maze-Visualizer

The idea is you click on the grid to make walls, which the algorithim then avoids, and then you click the algorithim you would like to use. When it is done, click on clear grid to reset and try again

# Algorithms Used

All the algorithms I used were ones that I had not a lot of experience working with outside the theory, so I wanted a project to show off what I know. Currently, all the algorithms are unweighted, which does take away some purpose for them, but I am hoping to add a weighted feature when I have the chance to.
The algorithims used were:
Dijkstra's Algorithm - Most famous one of pathfinding algorithim's and guarantees shortest path
A\* Algorithm - Best pathfinding algorithim based off performance, guarantees shortest path, based off of heuristic factors
Breadth-First Search - One of the first Algorithm's I learned, guarantees shortest path
Depth-First Search - Also of of the first Algorithm's I learned, does not guarantee the shortest path, arguabaly one of the worst pathfinding algorithims
